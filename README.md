# Task5
# Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Objective
The purpose of this project is to explore and analyze the Titanic dataset using statistical and visual techniques to extract meaningful insights.

## Tools Used
- Python (Jupyter Notebook)
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Files Included
- `train.csv` – Dataset used for analysis  
- `Titanic_EDA.ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook containing code, visualizations, and observations  
- `Titanic_Report.pdf` – Optional PDF report of the findings

## Project Overview

1. Loaded and explored the dataset using functions like `.info()`, `.describe()`, and `.value_counts()`.
2. Identified and handled missing values in relevant columns (`Age`, `Embarked`).
3. Performed univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis using appropriate plots:
   - Bar plots, histograms, boxplots
   - Pair plots and correlation heatmaps
4. Derived insights from each visualization and documented them clearly.
5. Summarized key findings based on observed trends and relationships.

## Key Findings
- Higher survival rates were observed among women and passengers in 1st class.
- Fare and passenger class (Pclass) were significant indicators of survival likelihood.
- Younger passengers had slightly higher chances of survival.

## Output
This repository contains a comprehensive exploratory analysis presented in both Jupyter Notebook and (optionally) PDF format for review and presentation.
